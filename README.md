# web-service-example-scripts
example scripts to demonstrate the use of the PRIDE Archive web service

Please note that these scripts are only meant to demonstrate possible use cases and provide a starting point for your own scripts. They are neither complete, failsafe nor should be used in real production use cases.

* **pride-webservice-client1.py** simple python script to demonstrate how to download details for one or more specific projects (datasets) from PRIDE Archive. For each specified project accession it will retrieve the available information and print some of it to the standard output as example.
* **pride-webservice-client2.py** simple python script to demonstrate how the PRIDE Archive web service could be used to search for projects (datasets). It will query the web service with the provided search term(s) and print example information for each retrieved result record to the standard output.
* **pride-webservice-client3.py** simple python script to demonstrate how protein (or peptide) identification records can be retrieved across several projects. Example records will be written to the standard output.
